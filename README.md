This repo is intended to serve only one purpose: build ANGLE for later use in Webrogue.

You are probably better to choose one of known alternatives:
- [jeremyfa/build-angle](https://github.com/jeremyfa/build-angle)
- [mmozeiko/build-angle](https://github.com/mmozeiko/build-angle)
- Build from source. Looks line there is a [good vcpkg package](https://vcpkg.io/en/package/angle.html)

All build scripts should be runnable both from GitHub Actions workflows and locally.
