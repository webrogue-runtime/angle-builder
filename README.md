This repo is intended to serve only one purpose: build ANGLE for later use in Webrogue.

Do NOT ask me to:
- Build ANGLE for Android
- Package headers
- Do something not related to Webrogue

If this repo doesn't suits your needs, try [this alternative repo](https://github.com/mmozeiko/build-angle) instead of opening issue.

All build scripts should be runnable both from GitHub Actions workflows and locally.
